## decision_igvc
Originally created for IGVC 2017. Contains nodes that make up a purely reactive system for navigating the IGVC autonomous navigation course.
## drag_race_iarrc
Originally created for IARRC 2017. Contains nodes for running the drag race course at IARRC.
## drivers
Contains any custom drivers developed in house. Usually these take the form of a ROS node that interacts with hardware external to the computer.
## firmware
Contains any firmware developed in house. Usually arduino code.
## localisation_igvc
Originally created for IGVC 2017. Contains nodes used to localise the robot (figure out where we are) based on sensor data.
## sample_package
Our "best practices" package, should contain a simple example for creating a node and associated tests. Reference this for package syntax, formatting, and structure.
## sb_gazebo
Contains all models and launch files used to simulate our robots in [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/).
## sb_utils
Contains general utility functions and classes that we commonly need to use across packages.
## sb_vision

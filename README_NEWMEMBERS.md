# Tips and advice 
For new members to help them get started.

## Terminal

In case you are new to the [Ubuntu command line](https://lifehacker.com/how-can-i-quickly-learn-terminal-commands-1494082178), which is primarily used over its graphical user interface.

## Github

Now if you are wondering where to start, a good place is understanding how our workflow **works.**

First of all, if you are new to GitHub, get started with this [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Pretty cool right? Now you might wonder how you can use GitHub right from the terminal, and it's called [Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

## C++

This is primarily the language we speak, so if you are new with C++, understand the fundamentals in this [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/)

## ROS

For learning more about ROS, the framework we use for all of our software, it is recommended to complete the intermediate tutorials or brush up on the basics if you feel like [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

## Workflow

We use the Forking Workflow, which you can learn about in **Github Conventions** in `README.md` (located in the same directory you opened this readme from) and other important information to a new software developer. If you have questions, you could find your answers over there. 

Rarely will your Github issues contain all the information that you need to resolve them. Using google to search for the specific issue is useful, or to help you find that missing piece of information you need to move on, but of course don't be afraid to ask for help, clarification, or just more information from any of the software leads.

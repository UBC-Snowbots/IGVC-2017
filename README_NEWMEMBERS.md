# Tips for New Software Members
Tutorials and advice to help you get started.

## Terminal

In case you are new to the [Ubuntu command line](https://lifehacker.com/how-can-i-quickly-learn-terminal-commands-1494082178): it is primarily used over the graphical user interface as it allows you to do more.

## Github

Now if you are wondering where to start, a good place is understanding how our workflow **works.**

First of all, if you are new to GitHub, get started with this [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Pretty cool right? Now you're wondering how you can use GitHub from the terminal/command line, it's called [Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

## C++

This is the language we use to develop most of our software, so if you are new with C++, understand the fundamentals or take reference from this [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/)

## ROS

For learning more about ROS, the framework we use in our software, you can complete the intermediate tutorials or brush up on the basics if you need to [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)

## Workflow

We use the Forking Workflow, which you can learn more about underÂ **Github Conventions** in `README.md` (located in the same directory you opened this readme from) and other important information to a new software member. If you have more questions, you may find your answers over there. 

##General Advice

Rarely will your Github issues contain all the information that you need to resolve them. Using google to search for that missing piece you need is sometimes useful (think like an optimist when you're understanding/interpreting your project/issue: "If only I knew how to do...", then search "how to do..."), or of course don't hesitate to ask for help, clarification, or just more information from any of the software leads. 

Remember it is much better to get help when you're stuck than to waste time trying to figure out what's wrong. This way, you're constantly progressing more or less, and as a whole, we develop efficiently and our software stack progresses.
